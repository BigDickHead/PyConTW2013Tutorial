Python Conference Taiwan 2013 Tutorial

The PyConTW (http://tw.pycon.org) organizer wishes to improve the quality and quantity of the programming cummunities in Taiwan. Though Python is their core tool and methodology, they know it's worth to learn and communicate with wide-ranging communities. Understanding cultures and ecosystem of a language takes me about three to six months. This six-hour course wraps up what I - a experienced Java developer - have learned from Python ecosystem and the agenda of the past PyConTW.
